# Introduction {#head}
Anybody can contribute to the project. To do this, you must follow these rules:

## Main {#main}
1. All changes must be clearly described in the Commit and Pull Request;
2. Behave decently. Do not use profanity and do not insult other project participants;
3. It is advisable to use the English language, as it is an international language.

## Branches {#branch}
- `main` - production branch
- `dev` - development branch

## Commits {#commits}
There are no clear rules for commits, but there are a few recommendations:
- Commits should preferably be in English
- Use [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org)

### Examples {#example}
1. <strike>Changed text</strike> ❌ The commit does not describe why the text was changed, where.
2. **chore(Faq): Added additional answer to the question** ✅ Perfect!

## Docs {#docs}
Documentation must be written in English language. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is used to write documentation.

## I am a developer of a library for your API, how do I add it to your documentation? {#add-sdk}
To do this, create a fork of the repository, add the necessary documentation using [Markdown formatting](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) and send a Pull Request to our repository.
To be in the documentation as a separate page, be sure to transfer repository ownership to the organization https://github.com/boticord
